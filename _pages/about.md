About Me
======
I am an enthusiast of Anime, Comics, and Games (ACG), an electronic music addict, and a Culer (supporter of FC Barcelona). 

Currently, I am a second-year Master's student in the [College of Pharmaceutical Sciences](http://cpsen.zju.edu.cn/) at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/), specializing in Artificial Intelligence Pharmacy. My primary research interests include cheminformatics, chemical language models and application of deep generative models in drug discovery.

I am honored to have joined [Prof. Tingjun Hou's research group](http://cadd.zju.edu.cn/en), where I am advised by both [Assoc. Prof. Yu Kang](https://person.zju.edu.cn/yukang) and [Prof. Tingjun Hou](https://person.zju.edu.cn/tingjunhou). Prior to this, I earned my BSc. degree from the [School of Pharmaceutical Sciences at Sun Yat-sen University](https://sps.sysu.edu.cn/), beginning my academic career supervised by [Assoc. Prof. Jinping Lei](https://sps.sysu.edu.cn/teacher/11366).
