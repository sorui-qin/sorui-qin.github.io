About Me
======
I am currently a second-year Master's student in the [College of Pharmaceutical Sciences](http://cpsen.zju.edu.cn/) at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/), specializing in Artificial Intelligence Pharmacy. I am also an enthusiast of Anime, Comics, and Games (ACG), an electronic music addict, and a Culer (supporter of FC Barcelona).

I am honored to have joined [Prof. Tingjun Hou's research group](http://cadd.zju.edu.cn/en), where I am advised by both **Assoc. Prof. Yu Kang** and **Prof. Tingjun Hou**. My primary research interests include **cheminformatics**, **chemical language models** and application of **generative models in drug discovery**. 

Prior to this, I earned my BSc. degree from the [School of Pharmaceutical Sciences at Sun Yat-sen University](https://sps.sysu.edu.cn/), beginning my academic career with supervision by Assoc. Prof. Jinping Lei.
